# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project stems from an eagerness to learn and challenge thyself. This project was built to help keep track of the learning and knowledge studied througout the course and help provide a reference point. I do not aim to start my own wikipedia page but this should serve as a reference point for specific tips and tricks that can make the learning process easier like hyperlinking the Git Cheat Sheet.

This project helped solve the lack of understanding on how the different coding languages work together and helped identify what each langauge is responsible for. A lot has been learned but my brain can act like a seieve sometimes and therefore cannot explain all what has been learned in this README however in simple terms, we have learned that each language has its own set of parameters that can be linked up to support a visually appealing and interactive site. Important skills such as Time boxing, agile and waterfall methology. The key thing i found from this was to preapre your brain to think in a partcular way "computational thinking".
